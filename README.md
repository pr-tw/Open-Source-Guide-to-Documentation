# [An Open-Source Guide to Documentation](https://pr-tw.github.io/Open-Source-Guide-to-Documentation/index.html)

Welcome to the documentation for _[An Open-Source Guide to Documentation](https://pr-tw.github.io/Open-Source-Guide-to-Documentation/index.html)_!

Writing good documentation is hard, managing and updating good docs is a project in of itself. The purpose of this book is to provide strategies that any maintainer can implement.

Documentation is an essential part of any open-source project. It helps users understand how to use your project and encourages them to contribute. In this book, we will cover the importance of documentation for open-source projects and how to plan, write, and maintain effective documentation.

## Who is this book for

This book is for anyone who wants to improve accessibility to technology. By writing good documentation, you can help improve participation of your community and strength the tools you bring.

Documentation is important for orienting users to a project. Users learn how to use and contribute to it, as well as the terms of use and standards of conduct. However, many open-source contributors do not frequently contribute to documentation, and incomplete or outdated documentation is a common issue. It is essential to use clear and accessible language when communicating in open-source projects, as nearly a quarter of the community may not speak or read English fluently.
