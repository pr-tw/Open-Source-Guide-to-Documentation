# About me

My name is Patrick Rachford, and I'm a highly experienced technical writer. I started my career on the AWS CloudFormation team and have focused on developer content ever since. I am committed to producing high-quality, accurate documents and have an extensive portfolio of successful projects.

In addition to writing, I am also a skilled editor and proofreader with some technical skills. I have helped large enterprises, start-ups, and open-source projects with their documentation. I am a highly motivated individual who is committed to delivering the highest quality work.

I am passionate about my work and am always willing to learn new skills and techniques to improve my craft. You can contact me at the following email address.
