# Maintaining and updating your documentation

The importance of maintaining and updating your documentation with your code base.

## Developing a documentation style guide

Developing a documentation style guide for your project is a way to maintain a singular and consistent voice across all documentation types.

Rather than creating a brand-new style guide, consider using existing ones.

- [Google](https://developers.google.com/style)
- [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
- [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html)

Style guides can remove common questions and enforce voice and tone across your documentation.

## Keeping your documentation up to date with new releases

As you ship updates to your product, ensure that your documentation is kept updated.
Users who come across old and outdated documentation can become frustrated. It is often said, that the only thing worse than no documentation is wrong documentation.

## Encouraging and responding to community feedback and contributions

Ensuring positive
Creating a code of conduct can help curb negative responses.
Using Pull Request and Issue templates will also help users to submit good ideas.
