# Planning and organizing your documentation

When creating documentation, consider the scope, goals, and format. Start with an outline to plan out the user's journey.
Any attempt to plan for documentation around the user's needs will greatly improve what is written.

## Defining your documentation's scope and goals

When defining the scope and goal of your documentation, consider how much information is necessary for your users to be successful. You should provide enough information for them to understand the full extent of your product, without overwhelming them with unnecessary details.

## Choosing the right format for your documentation

Markdown has become the de facto format for markup syntax in most open-source communities. There are other markup languages that have extensibility, with the most notable being [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org). AsciiDoc has many features over Markdown, like content reuse and modules.

Markdown is easy to read and easy to learn, which makes contributing to the documentation easier than formats like [DITA](http://dita.xml.org), [DocBook](https://docbook.org), or other XML formats.

When choosing the right format for your documentation, consider the learning curve and how complex your documentation needs to be to take advantage of higher level markup and XML syntaxes.

## Creating a documentation outline

Outlines provide a high-level overview of what will be covered in your documentation.
By spending time creating an outline, you can discover your user's journey and how they will approach the documentation.

When creating an outline for your documentation, you should consider how users will navigate through the information. Think about what topics are important and need to be covered, and break the documentation down into sections. By doing this, you can ensure that each page has a purpose and that the content is organized in a way that is easy to understand. Additionally, consider how you can use visuals such as images, diagrams, and videos to supplement the written content and make it easier to understand.
