# Content types

When writing your documentation, you should try to keep focus on which content type you're writing.

## Overview of documentation content

In 2017, Daniele Procida shared his ideas on _The four kinds of documentation_[^1]. I will be using Procida's ideas, _DiÃ¡taxis documentation framework_, which are also documented on the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr) website. While it can be argued that there are additional types of documentation, focusing on which type of documentation you're writing for your users will help maintain clarity and reach the objective.

### 1. Tutorials

> Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. Tutorials are learning-oriented. [^2]

A tutorial is a lesson focused on teaching practical skills, helping beginners gain basic competence with a product, so they can use it for their purposes. It should also show the learner that they can be successful with the product by having them do something meaningful and attainable. After completing a tutorial, the learner should be able to understand the product and the rest of the documentation. A good tutorial is essential for a product to acquire new users.

### 2. How-to guides

> How-to guides are directions that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. How-to guides are goal-oriented. [^3]

How-to guides are like recipes that provide step-by-step instructions to achieve a specific goal or solve a problem. They are important because they help users understand what a product is capable of doing and are often the most-read sections of documentation.

### 3. Reference

> Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference material is information-oriented. [^4]

Reference guides provide users with a concise description of a product, such as software, and how to use it. Reference material is essential to provide users with the truth and certainty they need to do their work with confidence.

### 4. Explanation

> Explanation is discussion that clarifies and illuminates a particular topic. Explanation is understanding-oriented. [^5]

Explanations are a type of documentation that provides a more in-depth understanding of a subject by exploring it from different angles. It is not a how-to guide or reference material, but rather a more relaxed, open-ended discussion of the topic. Explanation allows readers to consider the subject without being tied to the product itself.
