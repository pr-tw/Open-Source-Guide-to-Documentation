# Read me

A good project starts with a `README`.

Read me, are markdown files that describe the project.
When writing a Read me, you should ensure that you:

- describe what the project does
- the goal of the project
- how to install the project
- an example
- how to get started
- links to other references

## Describe what the project does

Sometimes when publishing a Readme, you've spent so much time with the product, you've forgotten the no one outside your team is aware of what the thing does or why it is needed.

## The goal of the project

You should explain what the intention of the project is. Describe what issue you're trying to eliminate and how the product accomplishes that.

## Install the project

Users will want to get started quickly. Make the installation step as easy as possible.
You should support a large variety of operating systems or platforms.

## Example

There should be an example that demonstrates the core proposition of the product.

## How to get started

Similar to the example, you should walk the user through a quick getting started guide. This should be a small enough project that a large portion of your audience can relate to the example, but big enough so that they can see the complexity in it.

## Links

You should always link to important pieces of the project.

- Community Slack
- Emails
- Documentation
- Reference guides
- APIs
